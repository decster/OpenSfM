# increase matched feature counts in image pair match
# tool analysis image pair match perf
# GMS based match
# rematch after geometric filter(after got fundamental matrix)
# try learned feature rather than SIFT/HAHOG

# detector learning
  # bootstrap learning, supervised learning first, then unsupervised
  # loss design:
    # input: homography pair pixel wise correspondence
    # loss: 
      * sparsity
      * pixel correspondence ~ featureness correspondence
